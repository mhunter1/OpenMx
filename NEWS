# OpenMx development
* IMPROVED: For normal SEM models (including RAM and LISREL), raw continuous data will often be evaluated as fast as covariance data instead of being much slower.
* IMPROVED: mxGenerateData now succeeds for joint ordinal and continuous data.
* NEW: mxSE() function. Calculate standard errors for arbitrary named entities (free parameters, matrices, algebras) and expressions.
* NEW: mxRun gives feedback about optimization progress
* IMPROVED: Continuous time state space models now allow non-invertible ("drift" or "dynamics") A matrices.
* IMPROVED: mxCI() Wu & Neale (2012) adjustment for parameters with upper or lower bounds. 
 * Use mxCI(..., boundAdj = FALSE) to disable the adjustment.
* IMPROVED: SLSQP now ignores inactive equality constraints and correctly report when inequality constraints cannot be satisfied.
* FIXED: mxTryHard() now no longer computes the Hessian and standard errors when there are MxConstraints in the model, which makes its behavior consistent with mxRun().

# OpenMx 2.6.9
* Stan header compatibility

# OpenMx 2.6.8
* Under the hood changes

# OpenMx 2.6.7
* CHANGED: Defaults number of threads = 2. Previously OpenMx used number of cores -1
 * This was done to reduce test-server burden for CRAN.
 * Set number of threads using mxOption(NULL, "Number of Threads", cores)
 * nb: multithreading supported on Linux and the OpenMx Team's build for Mac OS X.
* IMPROVED: CSOLNP optimizer better at calculating CIs.
* IMPROVED: It is now possible to augment the GREML fit-function with an arbitrary scalar-valued function, to be evaluated and added to the fit function value. This can be used to regularize model-fitting with a prior log likelihood.
* GREML fit function can also use analytic derivatives of the augmentation function.
* NEW: SLSQP multithreading to evaluate the numerical gradient.
 * Use mxFitFunctionML(..., rowwiseParallel = FALSE).
 * By default with raw data mxFitFunctionML() parallelizes evaluation of the row likelihoods not the gradients.
* NEW: mxOption, "Parallel diagnostics". Set to "Yes", OpenMx provides diagnostic messages about the use of multiple threads.
* IMPROVED: mxRestore() now behaves correctly with argument strict = TRUE.
* FIXED: A subtle bug in the GREML fit function has been repaired.
 * Under certain circumstances, this bug caused analytic derivatives of the covariance matrix to fail to be recalculated after changes in the values of the free parameters upon which they depend.
* NEW: Functions dnbinom(), pnbinom(), dpois(), and ppois() (from the stats package) are now usable in MxAlgebras.

# OpenMx 2.5.2
* NEW: mxFactorScores() enables regression factor-score estimates for RAM models!
* NEW: mxGenerateData() can generate data conditional on definition variables.
* NEW: SLSQP can use an analytic gradient during optimization.
* IMPROVED: mxTryHard() specially-tuned wrapper functions
 1. mxTryHardOrig()
 2. mxTryHardSSCT()
 3. mxTryHardWideSearch()
 4. mxTryHardOrdinal()
* NEW: imxRobustSE() calculates robust standard errors for parameter estimates from the sandwich estimator.
* NEW: functions in MxAlgebras:
 1. inverse trigonometric functions
 2. inverse hyperbolic functions
 3. logp2z() (standard-normal quantile function from log probabilities)
 4. lgamma1p() (accurate lgamma(x+1) for small x)
 5. Bessel functions, dbeta() pbeta()
* FIXED: Two mxGREMLDataHandler() behavior when blockByPheno = FALSE.
* FIXED: mxGREML automated handling of missing data when derivatives of the 'V' matrix are MxAlgebras.
* FIXED: LISREL path models now handle means correctly.
* IMPROVED: mxFactorScores() factor scores returned in original order
* FIXED: Factor-score estimates on factors with nonzero means resolved.
* IMPROVED mxFactorScores() no longer fails when SE are not available in the input model with type="ML" or type="WeightedML"
* IMPROVED: Several help pages have been updated, clarified, and made more complete.
* IMPROVED: Internal interface with NPSOL ensures optimizer consistently respects the "Major iterations" option.
* IMPROVED: Newton-Raphson optimizer handles encounters with parameter bounds less likely to cause convergence failure
* IMPROVED: mxGenerateData() now works with continuous-time state-space models.
* IMPROVED: Sufficient statistic likelihood adjusted to match the FIML value.
 * Prior versions (and Mx), did not correspond exactly to the full information formula.

# OpenMx 2.3.1
* NEW: Multi-group WLS has been implemented.
* NEW: Warning if Hessian is not convex at the solution (status code 5)
* NEW: mxRun() now displays the number of free parameters in the MxModel
* NEW: mxFactorScores() is now compatible with RAM models and multi-group models.
* NEW: coef() is now defined for MxModels (wrapper to omxGetParameters).
* NEW: mxCheckIdentification() is now compatible with GREML expectation.
* IMPROVED: mxTryHard().
* FIXED: A few bugs relating to state-space models have been repaired.
* IMPROVED: mxGetExpected()'s compatibility with LISREL models
* IMPROVED: SLSQP ability when starting at a solution.
* FIXED: Serious GREML bugs fixed. Now safe to use mxFitFunctionGREML(dv=)
* IMPROVED: GREML matrix operations streamlined.
* IMPROVED: Evaluation of GREML analytic derivatives parallelized
 * Note this increases memory demand
* SPEEDUP: mxMatrix construction and modification
* SPEEDUP: NPSOL "warm start" now works correctly.
 * mxComputeGradientDescent() can provide optimizer with Cholesky of Hessian matrix at the start values. can reduce function evaluations.
* NOTE: mxFactorScores() using 'ML' or'WeightedML' are deviations from the latent variable's mean.
 * If latent mean != 0, the scores must be shifted manually.
